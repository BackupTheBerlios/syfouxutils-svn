General Directions
------------------

What you will find here
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is a collection of utilities for the X Window System written over the years
to bring specialized or non-standard functionalities missing to some X
environments; these utilities all share a few common characteristics:

- They are all relatively simple, often contained as a single and relatively
  short source file.
- They are all targeted at POSIX systems.
- They do not depend on any widget toolkits: only on Xlib.
- They generally avoid using any libraries besides libc and Xlib.
- They are light on resources.
- They are WM-agnostic (when applicable, they comply with the EWMH).

*******************************************************************************
They are distributed "'as-is'" under a BSD license (see
<<copyright,Redistribution Conditions>> below), in the hope they will be useful
to 'experimented'  end-users and programmers looking for quick fixes, or for
simple working caveats to reuse and extend.

Getting the source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The code is available through http://subversion.tigris.org/[Subversion].
You can get it anonymously by doing:

-----------------------------------------------------
svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/syfouxutils/trunk/
-----------------------------------------------------

Further directives and explanation can be found
http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=7820[online].

What do do from here
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The source layout is pretty simple: each utility is stored in its own,
stand-alone subdirectory of the trunk (plus `site`, which depends on everything
else and contains this web site). All utilities come fully self-documented, with
instruction on how to build and use. The most elaborate ones also have
additional documentation, available as plain text. What you must do is to:

. `cd` to the directory containing the utility you are interested in.
. Lookup the source code or the additional documentation for instructions.
. Build it then use it, as appropriate.

For your convenience, all the documentation on a per-utility basis is reproduced
below.
